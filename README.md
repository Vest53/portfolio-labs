Hands-on cybersecurity labs covering SOC analysis, incident response, networking, forensics and security tools such as Nmap, Wireshark and SIEM.
I am revisiting the TryHackMe learning path with a more structured approach.
This time, I am documenting my studies, notes, and practical exercises in this GitHub repository to consolidate my knowledge and demonstrate continuous learning in cybersecurity.

Today, I completed two labs that covered the main areas of a Security Operations Center (SOC) and their respective roles and responsibilities.
In addition, I performed an investigation on a suspicious IP address identified in the company logs, applying basic log analysis and incident triage concepts.
